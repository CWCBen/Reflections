What happens when you initialize a repository? 
	creates the .git file that tracks changes

Why do you need to do it?
	because .git file is what makes the git repository a git repository - otherwise it is just a normal folder

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
	staging is different from the working dir in that not all files in the working dir are going to be a part of the staging area - maybe files that you never want to change - working dir is a gen folder - staging area is for files that we want to add to the git repository

What value do you think it offers?
	the value of a working dir being seperated from the staging area is that it allows us to have a logical place to keep our files in the same folder but not have to add them all to the git repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Probably best practice to only add the files relevant to the major change per each commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches are great for testing experimental features or differeing versions of a program or application - allow testing without a commitment to the master branch
