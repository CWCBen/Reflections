When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Working remotely or if others have made changes or addtions to a shared resources

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository
	This could cause a ton of network traffic and start over-writing un-intended changes. 

Github is a part of Git  - a hosted website
git remote - referes to a repository and is a kind of pull or push for a particualar branch - it also is involved in cloning
git push - is a way for us to push changes to GitHub
git pull - is a way for us to pull changes down from GitHub

If we want to push changes to a git that has been worked on since our last pull we will need to pull again - then push the combined changes up all at once
