Verson Control Notes



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Able to go back and find mistakes fast
	See how the program evolved over time and why

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Able to have logical changes - coment on changes and keep track of purpose

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Most programs run off of multiple files and therefor is makes sense to track changes accross the repository rather than multiple files.

	Google docs is more for individual documents rather than full repositories

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I feel like I can break things with impunity so long as I do a good save beforehand!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Yelling at small children
